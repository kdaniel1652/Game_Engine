## Overview

**Game Engine** is a custom-built game engine developed in C++, leveraging the power of SDL2, Sol/Lua, and other essential libraries. Designed for high-performance game development, it provides a flexible architecture for rendering, scripting, and game logic.

## Features

- **Rendering Engine** – Powered by SDL2 for basic graphics rendering.
- **Scripting Support** – Lua integration via Sol for flexible game logic.
- **Physics & Collision** – Efficient physics simulation and collision detection.
- **Entity Component System (ECS)** – Modular architecture for scalable development.
- **Input Handling** – Supports keyboard and mouse

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- **GLM** (for mathematics and vector operations)
- **Lua** (for scripting support)
- **SDL2** (for input & window management)
- **SDL Mixer** (for audio support)
- **Sol** (C++-Lua binding library)
- **tinyxml2** (for XML parsing)

### Build Instructions

```bash
```

## Usage

### Running a Game Script
You can write game scripts in Lua and load them into the engine:

```lua
```

Place the script in the `scripts/` directory and load it into the engine:

```cpp

```
